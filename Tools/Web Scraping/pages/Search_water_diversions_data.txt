About Structures
Description
Administrative structures are a variety of things -- see the data dictionary for a list of structure types -- used for diverting, storing, releasing, measuring or managing water. Structures may be on-stream of off-stream, and are associated with a specific water source.
Diversion Records are associated with Structures. See guidance document
How to Get Structure Diversion Records from CDSS
