Make a Colorado Open Records Act request to review public files
If we have any files on that address, we’ll set up an appointment with you to review the files.
Just because we don't have any files on a property doesn't necessarily mean the property is uncontaminated. It may be that contamination hasn't yet been discovered and/or reported to us.
If you wish to review files from another division (Air, Water, etc.), you must contact each division individually.
