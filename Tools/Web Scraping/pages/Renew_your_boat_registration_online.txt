Any boat with a motor or sail operated in Colorado on any public waters must be registered with Colorado Parks and Wildlife.​​​
​
2022-2023 Temporary Registrations
NEW Process: Colorado Parks and Wildlife will no longer provide a bright green temporary registration by mail for new registrations or renewals. Instead, customers can now use their emailed confirmation receipt (valid for 60 days) as their temporary registration until you receive your registration card and decals in the mail. The emailed confirmation receipt will be sent to the email address you have on file. If you do not receive your registration card and decals within 30 days, please contact Colorado Parks and Wildlife at 303-297-1192.
​​​​​​​​​Registration and registration renewals are required annually and are 
         valid from January 1 through December 31 each year.
Registrations and registration renewals can be done 45 days prior to the registration expiration date (Dec. 31).
Who must register:
Colorado residents are required
to regist​er their boats with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and must provide
acce​pt​​able proof of ownership
.
Non-residents:
Vessels from other states may be ope
rated in Colorado for up to 60 days with a current registration from the owner's state.
​​How to Register​​
To register your boat, complete the
Boat Registration form
​and return it,
along with your
proof of ownership
,​ to:
Colorado Parks and Wildlife-Registration Unit
13787 S Highway 85
Littleton, CO 80125
You may also register your boat at Colorado Parks and Wildlife offices. ​
Please
see our Contact Us page
for a list of office locations, or call the Registration Unit at 303.297.1192 for a location near you.
Registration Fees
​​​​​​​​
New ANS Stamp Required
​
Motorboats and sailboats must have an aquatic nuisance species (ANS) Stamp prior to launching in Colorado. This change took effect Jan. 2019.
For more information, see the
Boat ANS Inspection & Decontamination
​ page.
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
​
The annual registration fees are determined by the length of the boat. Current fees are as follows:
Less than 20 feet in length - $35.25
20 feet to less than 30 feet - $45.25
30 feet or greater - $75.25
ANS stamp: Motorboats & Sailboats from Colo. - $25.00
ANS stamp: Motorboats & Sailboats from another state - $50.00​
Registrations are valid from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 each year. This is a flat administrative transaction fee - it cannot be prorated for a partial year's registration and will not be subject to refund if the boat is sold or stolen.
Registration Renewals
Renew Your Registration Online
Online registration renewal for vehicles and vessels is now available to people who already have their vehicle registrations added to their CPWShop.com accounts.
Verify you can renew your registration online and find online renewal instructions on the main
Registrations
page.
​
​​
Registration renewal cards are mailed to currently registered owners each November. Registration​s are valid from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 each year. You may also
renew your registration online
. You MUST have your registration number to renew online or please call 303-297-1192 to get your information.​
Purchasing a Boat
​When you purchase a boat, you may use your Bill of Sale as a temporary registration for 30 days. If purchasing a boat from a private party, have the seller provide you with a Bill of Sale to serve as your proof of ownership. An acceptable bill of sale includes:
both the seller and buyer’s printed names and signatures,
the boat hull identification number (if any),
the boat make, model and year (if known) and
the date of the sale.
An acceptable private party to private party
Bill of Sale template
​ can be downloaded here for your use. The Bill of Sale must be carried on the boat while operating until the registration decals and card get to you in the mail.
Sorry, at this time, on-line registration for a newly purchased boat is not available.
Out-of-state Boats
Vessels from other states may be operated in Colorado for up to 60 days with a current registration from the owner's state.
Canoes and kayaks, and other craft that do not require registration must be legibly marked with the name and address of the owner.
Decal Placement
The Colorado Registration Number assigned to your boat must be painted or attached to each side of the bow on the forward half of the vessel. For general decal placement instructions, see the
Registration Decal Placement Brochure
.
For boat decal placement, see:
Boat Decal Placement - Left
Boat Decal Placement - Right
These numbers must be a minimum of 3 inches in height and be of contrasting color to the boat. The yearly decals needs to be placed to the left of the Registration number on both sides of the boat.​
New ANS Stamp Required
​​
​Motorized watercraft and sailboats must have an ANS Stamp prior to launching in Colorado.
Boat operators must retain proof of purchase (electronic or printed receipt) when boating in Colorado. Resident stamps are $25.00 and non-residents are $50.00. ​
If you register/renew your vessel online or via a registration renewal postcard, the cost of the ANS stamp appears as part of your total amount due. You do NOT need to manually add another $25 to your payment for an ANS stamp.​
Funding contributes to prevention and management of ANS in the state. To learn more about the ANS Stamp, visit our
Frequently Asked Questions​
