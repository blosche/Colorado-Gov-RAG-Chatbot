The aim of the Noxious Weed Program is to control noxious weeds, the non-native aggressive invaders that replace native vegetation, reduce agricultural productivity, cause wind and water erosion and pose an increased threat to communities from wildfire. We do this by preventing the introduction of new invasive species; eradicating species with isolated or limited populations and containing and managing those invasive species that are well-established and widespread.
To accomplish these goals the program coordinates the efforts of local, state and federal noxious weed managers; provides funding for local entities to carry out on-the-ground weed management projects; conducts education and outreach activities and supports similar local activities; and maintains close contact with neighboring states and counties to prevent the interstate spread of noxious weeds.
