Welcome to the Brand Inspection Division
We have been part of Colorado's history in one form or another since 1865.  Our job is to protect Colorado's $3 billion livestock industry from loss by theft or straying.  Check out our website to find more information about our mission, our inspectors, and the laws and regulations that guide us.
We look forward to working with you.
