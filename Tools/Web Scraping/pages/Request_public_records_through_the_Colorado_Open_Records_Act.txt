Information Requested
List information requested. Please note that personally identifiable information (PII) such as place and date of birth, home address, social security number, physical description, photograph, or signature of any person is always redacted prior to release of public records. Likewise, electronic mail addresses provided by a person to the department to aid in future communication are not disclosed to the public. Some records, such as tax or driving records, may be protected from disclosure to anyone but the person in interest, while other records are entirely exempt from public inspection due to statutes that specifically prohibit their release.
