About this case
About this case
OUR MISSION
The Colorado Cold Case Database features unsolved homicides, missing person, and unidentified person cases to assist law enforcement agencies in the development of information, which can lead to the identification, and arrest of any person(s) who may have committed any crime described on this page. If you have information on any of the persons, or cases found on this page, you are encouraged to contact CBI or the investigating agency.
It is the sincerest hope of all those involved in the CBI Cold Case Unit's efforts that the necessary tips and information can be provided to the agencies investigating these "cold cases" such that they may resolve their own investigations and provide some justice and resolution to these tragedies.
"Their voices may now be silent . . . those who may know the truth are not."
