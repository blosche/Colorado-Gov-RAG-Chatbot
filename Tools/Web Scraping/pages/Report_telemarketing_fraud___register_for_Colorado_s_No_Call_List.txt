In 2001, the Colorado General Assembly passed legislation that allows consumers to protect 
    themselves from many unwanted telemarketing calls. As of June 1, 2003, consumers 
    may add their wireless telephone numbers to the Colorado No Call List as well. If you do 
    not want to receive telemarketing calls or faxes, you may add your number to the form on 
    the right. To submit a complaint, use the form on the
Complaints
page.
Coloradans must now register on two do not call lists. To be sure that you are included on a no call list and so telemarketers do not call, Coloradans are encouraged to register on both this website and the National Do Not Call Registry.
    Recently, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stopped accepting no call information from the states. Registration may be done on the Internet, at the National Do Not Call Registry website
http://www.ftc.gov/donotcall
, or by calling 1-888-382-1222 (TTY 1-866-290-4236). More information is available on the website.  The Public Utilties Commission recommends that subscribers register on both sites.
This site enables consumers to add or remove their residential, wireless,
    or fax telephone numbers to the Colorado No-Call List. By
adding
your 
    residential, wireless, or fax telephone number(s), telemarketers
will not
call you. To add: enter your residential, wireless, or fax
    telephone number(s), zip code and e-mail (optional) into the box on this page.
If you have added your residential, wireless, or fax telephone 
    number(s) to the Colorado No-Call List and for some reason you would like to remove your 
    number(s), you may do so at this site. By
removing
your residential,
    wireless, or fax telephone number(s) telemarketers
will
be able to call you. To 
    remove: enter your residential, wireless, or fax telephone number(s), zip code and 
    e-mail (optional) into the box on this page.
It is a violation of the law to add or remove someone's residential, wireless, or fax telephone number(s)
    without his or her authorization.
Some telephone solicitation calls are permissible under Colorado's No-Call Law.
