Reasons to tell
We encourage you to come forward as soon as possible when you learn about something that may cause harm to others or yourself. When you see something, say something.
By reaching out to Safe2Tell, you can help someone who is struggling. If your desire is to protect, prevent, or help, send in your report. If you’re unsure whether you should send in a report or not, and you are making a report to protect, prevent, or help, send it in.
How it works
Reports can be submitted by calling
1-877-542-SAFE (7233)
, using the link on the website,  through our
mobile app
, or by texting
S2TCO
to
738477.
After you submit your report, watch for any follow up questions, because the more information you share, the better the response to your report will be. Safe2Tell will send your report to appropriate school and/or law enforcement officials and verify report receipt and response.
