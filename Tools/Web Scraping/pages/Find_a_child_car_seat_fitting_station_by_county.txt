Car Seat Fit Recommendations
Is Your Child in the Right Car Seat?
Using the correct car seat could save your child's life. Vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for children, but many deaths can be prevented. It is your responsibility to make sure children younger than 16 are properly and safely secured during every trip.
Match Size to the Seat
There are no standard size requirements for car seat fit. Even if your child looks big enough to move to the next size seat,
be sure to follow all manufacturer recommendations on the car seat label
. Car seats, booster seats and seat belts are developed to protect children based on their sizes, not their ages.
If you have any questions about whether your child's seat meets federal safety standards, has been recalled or is installed correctly, call one of our
inspection stations
and talk to a certified technician.
