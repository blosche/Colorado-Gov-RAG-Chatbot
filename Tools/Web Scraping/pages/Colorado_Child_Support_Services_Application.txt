Colorado Child Support Services Application
We Put Children First
The Colorado Division of Child Support Services (CSS) works with parents and
								caretakers to make sure all Colorado kids get the financial support they need to thrive.
We're making it easier for Colorado families to apply for, and receive, child
								 support services.  You can now complete an application for child support services online.
								 Our online application will guide you through the process based on your family's situation.
Once you submit your application, you will not be able to make additional changes.
								 The submission activates the county review period.  During this time, your county child support
								 office will be in touch with you to gather the required
								 legal documents needed to complete the application process.
We strongly encourage you to complete your application online.  This is a
								 streamlined process that will get your information to your county child support office faster.
								 If you are unable to do this, a printable version in
English
or
Espanol
is available.  Please complete and mail the
								 printed application to your county child support office.
CSS Tip:  Do not fill out this online application for child support services
								 if you are receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).  Your case may have
								 already been referred to us.  Contact the child support office in the county you are
								 currently receiving TANF benefits to find out the status of your case.
We are here to help you and your family.  If you have questions, please
								 contact your
local county child support office
