Important Identity Verification Information
Please note that in the best interest of all taxpayers, the Colorado Department of Revenue implements measures to detect and prevent identity theft related refund fraud. Please be aware that these measures, meant to ensure state tax dollars are going to the right person, could delay individual income tax refunds. If you have received a letter requesting that you verify your identity and/or tax return details, it is important that you promptly respond to the letter.

Check Refund Status Online
You can check the status of your refund on
Revenue Online
. There is no need to login. Simply choose the option "Where's My Refund for Individuals" in the box labeled "Refund Resources". Then, enter your SSN or ITIN and the refund amount you claimed on your current year's income tax return. If you do not know the refund amount you claimed, you may use a Letter ID number from a recent income tax correspondence from the Department.
Please note that it usually takes about 7-10 business days for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver the refund checks, but occasionally it can take up to 30 days. After we have received and processed your return,
Revenue Online
will provide you with an updated status as the refund moves through our system. It may take a few days for an updated status to appear. Please check back often to verify where your return/refund may be in our process.
If your refund check has not been received after 30 days from the issued date, or has been destroyed, lost or stolen, please call (303) 238-7378
and request to have a refund reissue form mailed to you.
The information in
Revenue Online
is the same information available to our Call Center representatives. You can get the information without waiting on hold.

Frequently Asked Questions
I can't check the status. What do I do?
Please verify the refund amount you have entered and verify that you are using the primary SSN for the return/refund. You may want to try using a Letter ID instead of the refund amount.
You have not updated the status of my refund in a while. When will I receive it?
Each return processes through multiple steps. We recommend you file electronically and include all documentation to ensure we can process your return/refund as quickly as possible. Please check back on the status daily. If we require additional information, we will contact you through U.S. Postal Service mail.
I received a "Validation Key" letter. Will that delay my refund?
In the best interest of all our taxpayers, the Colorado Department of Revenue implements measures to detect and prevent identity theft-related refund fraud.  The Department has a "Validation Key" process where information will be requested to be entered on Revenue Online to validate their Colorado refund.
Please be aware that if you do not respond to the validation key letter in a timely manner your refund will be delayed
. Visit the
Identity Verification web page
for more information.
My check was mailed. Where is it?
Please note that it usually takes about 7-10 business days for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver the refund checks, but occasionally it can take up to 30 days. If your refund check has not been received after 30 days from the issued date, or has been destroyed, lost or stolen, please call (303) 238-7378 and request to have a refund reissue form mailed to you.
Why was my direct deposit converted to a paper check?
Some refunds that are requested as Direct Deposit may be converted to paper check and mailed to the taxpayer's address as a method of verifying that the refund is legitimate. A letter will come with the refund that was converted to a paper check. The letter contains a phone number taxpayers can call. Please
visit the Direct Deposit page
for more information.
