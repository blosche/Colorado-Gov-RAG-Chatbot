Submit any further questions about this process to that same email address.

Public Adjuster Licensing
Please note that Colorado licenses ONLY public adjusters. Public adjusters are those who work solely for the public on a contract basis. Colorado DOES NOT license company or staff adjusters. IF YOU ARE AN ADJUSTER OTHER THAN A PUBLIC ADJUSTER, PLEASE DO NOT APPLY FOR AN ADJUSTER LICENSE IN COLORADO.
Pursuant to §10-2-417(2), C.R.S. and Colorado Insurance Regulation 1-2-19, you must provide a $20,000 signed Surety Bond from an insurance company and a Power of Attorney in the format defined in the regulation above. Your signed Surety Bond and Power of Attorney should be attached electronically in Sircon after submission of your application. Mailing or failing to attach the Surety Bond and the Power of Attorney may delay the processing of your application.
If you need additional information on adjuster licensing, please contact Pearson VUE at 800-275-8247.
