Hello Colorado!
Welcome to the Governor's Dashboard, where we invite you to take an in depth look at our progress addressing important issues affecting our state and citizens
This dashboard provides a summary of how we are progressing on the Governor’s vision of reducing the high cost of living in our state, and creating a Colorado where everyone has an opportunity to succeed. By providing free full-day kindergarten for every Colorado student, lowering the cost of health care, and harnessing the economic and societal benefits of clean energy, we can ensure our economy works for everyone while preserving Colorado’s unique way of life.
Colorado has been recognized for several years by
Results for America
as a leading state in setting strategic goals as well as data culture and data policies, largely influenced by the Governor's Dashboard.
