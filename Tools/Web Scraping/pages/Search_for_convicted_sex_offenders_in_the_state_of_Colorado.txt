Any action taken by you towards a registered sex offender, including vandalism of property, verbal or written threats of harm or physical assault against this person, his or her family or employer can result in your arrest and prosecution. You must contact your local Police Department or Sheriff's Office immediately if you believe a crime is being, or will be committed. If you have any questions regarding this matter, contact your local Police Department or county Sheriff's office.
DISCLAIMER: The Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) maintains and is continuously in the process of evaluating the accuracy and integrity of all sexual offender registration records to determine if the data fulfills the minimum requirements for all Internet postings. Therefore, at this time, all qualifying sexual offender records may not appear on this website. These records are being updated hourly and will be posted to the website as soon as they are available. If you believe any information found in these records is incorrect or if you have any questions, please contact CBI's Program Support Unit at (303) 239-4222, or at

PUBLIC NOTICE & USER AGREEMENT
The information on this site is being provided to the public pursuant to Colorado Revised Statute (CRS) 16-22-111. You must read and accept this user agreement before you may access restricted areas of this site.
*** PUBLIC NOTICE & DISCLAIMER ***
CBI cannot ensure the records obtained through this website relate to the person you are seeking information. Searches based on names, dates of birth and other alphanumeric identifiers are not always accurate. The only way to positively link someone to a sex offender record is through fingerprint verification. The information provided may not reflect the current residence, status, or other information regarding a registrant (offender). The information listed is what has been reported to CBI. CBI will update information when it becomes available.
Neither the CBI, nor the State of Colorado, shall be responsible for any errors or omissions produced by secondary dissemination of information from the CBI Sex Offender Website. Extreme care should be exercised when using any information obtained from this website. Make sure the records you access through this website pertain to the person you are seeking information.
The CBI does not post information concerning (1) sex offenders only convicted of misdemeanor sex offenses, or (2) juveniles adjudicated for sex crimes. You may contact your local Police Department, county Sheriff's office, or the CBI for a complete list of registered sex offenders in your city, county or state. Some Police Departments and Sheriff's Offices maintain websites containing information about sex offenders in their jurisdiction, consistent with CRS 16-22-112. Please select the Information tab for links to view specific Colorado Police and Sheriff's sex offender websites.
You must contact your police department or Sheriff's office immediately if you believe a crime is being, or will be, committed. If you have any questions regarding this matter, contact your local police department or county sheriff's office.
Registrants are mapped to the best ability with the data provided; CBI makes no guarantee of the validity of the mapped locations of registrants.
The following information is provided as an awareness tool so that you can adequately protect yourself and your children from these individuals. The use of the sex offender registry information to harass, endanger, intimidate, threaten or in any way seek retribution on an offender through illegal channels is prohibited. Any person who engages or participates in such acts may be charged criminally.
