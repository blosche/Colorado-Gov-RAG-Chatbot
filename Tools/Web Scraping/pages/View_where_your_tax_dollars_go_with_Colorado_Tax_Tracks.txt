The breakouts are based on the income groups used in the 2000 Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) and only go as high as that data. Therefore, the highest annual adjusted money income that is differentiated by this program is $150,000.
What is Annual Adjusted Money Income?
This includes income earned from wages and profits of businesses, persons,
             and farmers along with earnings from savings or investments such as dividends,
             rent or interest. Capital gains from the sales of assets are also included.
             Transfer payments (such as public assistance with the exception of in-kind
             services such as public housing), pension and retirement income, and
             alimony are also included in Annual Adjusted Money Income.
