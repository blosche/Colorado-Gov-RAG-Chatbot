Plan Your Next Adventure at a 
Colorado State Park!
Wherever you go in Colorado, there’s a state park waiting to welcome you. 
Mountains or prairies, rivers or forests, out in the country or next to the 
city… Colorado’s 42 state parks are as diverse as the state itself, and they 
offer something for everyone. Take a hair-raising whitewater river trip, or kick 
back in a lawn chair and watch the sunset. Enjoy a family picnic, cast a line in 
the water, take a hike, ride a horse, try snowshoeing or discover geocaching. 
From Eastern Plains parks at 3,800 feet to high-mountain parks at 9,500, the 
network of state parks offers a wealth of activities for busy people of all 
ages, or the chance to do nothing at all. You can play on land or on water. On a 
high peak or on the prairie. In the country or the city. In spring, summer, 
winter or fall.
