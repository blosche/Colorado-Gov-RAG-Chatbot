What is a State Wildlife Area?
State Wildlife Areas (SWAs) are state- or privately-owned lands that offer 
	wildlife-related recreation to the public. While most activities focus on 
	hunting and fishing, each SWA has different allowed activities, based on 
	location and available resources. These parcels of SWA land are paid for by 
	sportspeople and managed under state law by Colorado Parks and Wildlife 
	employees for the benefit of wildlife. Colorado Parks and Wildlife manages 
	about 350 SWA lands around the state. For more information, please see the
Colorado State Recreation Lands brochure
(
Folleto de tierras recreativas del estado de Colorado
).
A
valid hunting or fishing license OR SWA pass
is required for everyone
16 or older
accessing most state wildlife areas
. For more information, read the
frequently asked questions
.
These can be purchased through
CPW authorized sales agents
, by phone (1-800-244-5613) or online at
CPWShop
.
State Wildlife Area Restrictions Have Been Updated
Changes have been made to regulations that standardize and clarify language for permissible activities on many state wildlife areas. These went into effect August 1, 2023. Please review the listed restrictions for SWAs and for the SWA you plan to visit as access and allowances may have changed. See pages 3–30 of the
Colorado State Recreation Lands brochure
