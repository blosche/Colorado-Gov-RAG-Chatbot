Description
A Water Right is a property right that is either conditional or absolute and conveys the right to use a particular amount of water, with a specified priority date as confirmed by the water court.
The Transaction dataset contains the court decreed actions that affect amount and use(s) that can be used by each water right.
The Net Amounts dataset contains the current status of a water right based on all of its court decreed actions.
