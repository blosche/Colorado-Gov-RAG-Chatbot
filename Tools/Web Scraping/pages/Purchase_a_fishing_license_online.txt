Things to know when buying online or by phone
​The 2024 annual license year runs 3/1/2024 - 3/31/2025 (13 months).
​​Customers may use Visa, MasterCard or Discover credit cards, and now CPW gift certificates to purchase their license. Visa, Mastercard, or Discover debit cards work if they can be used without a PIN. Licenses are mailed the business day following the purchase.
Items sent via standard shipping may take 30 days to arrive from your order date. If you need your product sooner, you need to select "pick-up at sales location" or pay the extra fee for express shipping.
A temporary authorization number (TAN) can be used until the license(s) are received in the mail. The TAN is currently valid for 45 days after date of purchase. Please print or write down (must be legible) the TAN and carry it with you while fishing until you receive your license. If the license OR all of the licenses you purchase in this transaction expire in less than 15 days, you will NOT receive the license(s) in the mail; in this situation you are required to carry the TAN with you while fishing. ​
If there​ are any issues, please contact the call center at (303) 297-1192 or a CPW park or office.
Telephone sales representatives at 1-800-244-5613 are trained to sell licenses and do not know specific wildlife-related information for Colorado. For questions not related to the sale of licenses, call Colorado Parks and Wildlife at (303) 297-1192.​​
