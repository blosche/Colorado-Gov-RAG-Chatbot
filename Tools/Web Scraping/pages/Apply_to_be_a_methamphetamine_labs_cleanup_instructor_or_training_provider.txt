General information
Methamphetamine (meth) labs may leave contamination on hard surfaces like walls, countertops, sinks or heating and air conditioning ducts, and may also be absorbed into soft surfaces like furniture, drapes and carpeting. Contamination may also occur when meth is smoked in a property.
Even in small amounts, meth lab contaminants may pose health risks to people exposed to them.
Statutes and regulations require that properties contaminated by meth labs or meth use be cleaned up in accordance with standards established by the state Board of Health, or the property owner may elect to demolish the property instead. The statues and regulations also apply to vehicles contaminated by meth labs or meth use.
A property owner who cleans up a property in compliance with the regulations has immunity from civil lawsuits by future owners, occupants or neighbors related to the meth lab as long as verification testing is conducted by a qualified professional and a copy of the results is provided to the local governing body (as defined in statute).
Meth contaminated properties that don’t meet the regulatory requirements are deemed a public health nuisance.
For questions about health effects of meth lab chemicals or byproducts, call 303-692-2700.​
Reporting a suspected lab or illegal disposal
To report a known or suspected meth lab, contact your local law enforcement agency or drug task force.
To report suspected disposal down the sanitary sewer, contact your local wastewater treatment authority. Your local public works department or other city offices can help you determine how to do this.
Contact your local health department, building department or law enforcement agency to find out if the cleanup will be handled locally.
Records review
Copies of reports that have been filed with the division may be obtained through our record center.
