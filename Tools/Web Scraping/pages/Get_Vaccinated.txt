Vaccines protect you and your loved ones from serious diseases like measles, polio, flu, COVID-19, and more. If you have a primary care provider and insurance, including Medicaid, Medicare, or CHP+, ask if they provide routine vaccines.
CDC requires all
Health Insurance Marketplace
plans and most other private insurance plans to cover
recommended vaccines
. If you do not have health insurance, or your plan doesn’t fully cover certain vaccines, you can get
no or low cost vaccines from a provider enrolled in a federal vaccine program
.
