Welcome to the Colorado Volunteer Mobilizer (CVM) for Medical and Non-Medical Volunteers
This site is used to register, notify, and inform individuals who are interested in volunteering in the event of an accidental or intentional emergency, or other public or health care disaster. This site can also be used to register and notify other industries in the event of an emergency. If this is your first visit, click "Register" button to register in the system. If you are already registered, click "Log In" button at left.
As you know from recent events, both manmade and natural disasters will tax public health and medical resources at the local and state levels. We are currently working to recruit and train individuals from the following areas: Physicians, Nurses, Pharmacists, Respiratory Therapists, EMT/Paramedics, Behavioral/Mental Health and Veterinary/animal response to name a few, to respond to "all hazards" incidents. Your involvement as a volunteer will help ensure that people or animals affected by a disaster will receive the public health and medical care they need. Registration in the on-line database is your first step in meeting this urgent need within Colorado and the nation. Once you have registered with us, your license will be verified through Department Of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) and a background check will be conducted through the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI). If approved you will receive notification of your acceptance into the system, upcoming training opportunities, and periodic news updates. The information that you provide is not considered confidential and is public record, but will not be misused in any way. This secure system will also be used to contact you in case of an emergency, using email and telephone notifications.
THANK YOU!
