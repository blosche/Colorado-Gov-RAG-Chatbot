What is Hemp?
Hemp means the plant species
Cannabis sativa
L. and any part of the plant, whether growing or not, containing a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration of no more than three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) on a dry weight basis.
Under State and Federal law, the CDA tests for
total
THC through the process of post-decarboxylation.
The Colorado Department of Agriculture's Hemp Program regulates only the cultivation of hemp. The Department also administers a certified seed program.
The Hemp Program does not have jurisdiction over the processing, sale or distribution of hemp.
Application Fees are Non-Refundable
